    <h1>Oslo</h1>
        <p>Oslo is Norway's capital and largest city, with 690,000 citizens in the city proper and about 1.5 million inhabitants in greater Oslo. 
        It is in the East of the country in the Oslofjorden fjord, extending over an inlet of the Skagerrak strait. 
        It is surrounded by green hills and mountains and includes 40 islands and 343 lakes. Oslo offers ski slopes for alpine skiing and 
        ski trails for cross-country skiing in the winter. In the summer, the temperature in Oslo may make it comfortable to swim. 
        There are several well-visited beach resorts. Oslo is one of the world's northernmost capitals and so gets only 6 hours of sunlight in the winter. 
        In high summer, sunlight hours soar to 18, making its climate markedly different between seasons, with cold yet relatively dry winters.</p>

    <h2>Understand</h2>
    <p>Oslo is the demographic, economic and political centre of Norway. As the capital of Norway, Oslo hosts several national institutions. 
        The city has a good selection of cultural institutions and a good selection of restaurants, some world class but most ordinary, as well as night life in general. 
        While it is an expensive city for overseas visitors, many of the best things are free of charge, notably Oslo's proximity to wild nature and variety of outdoor activities.</p>
